## A Samurai Story
> サムライの物語

Hanakotobo is the symbolism of flowers in Japan. Some flowers are meant to be given at new beginnings and some at final goodbyes. I wanted to play around with this idea and tell the life of a samurai trough the meaning of these flowers.

## Pages

> Home

The title alternates between the English and Japanese title and the image behind it was created using Leonardo Ai.

> Cherry blossoms

The cherry blossoms represent new beginnings and thus, in our story, mean the samurai's birth. When you hover over them they can change size, and they are spawned randomly every time the page is refreshed.

> Bonsai

The bonsai represents discipline and training. This is the early part of the samurais' life, where they train to improve their skills.

> Red Chamomile

This flower represents love and also the first love of our samurai. This is an interactive component where you need to drag the flower onto the stem to complete it. If you hover over the flower it becomes bigger.

> Spider Lilly

Sadly I couldn't complete this on time because I just couldn't get the 3D file implemented. The spider lilly represents a final goodbye and thus the death of the samurai in our story.

> White Chrysanthemum
This flower is the flower of grief. To be honest I just added this so I could make the background dramatically change to white and make a white version of the samurai helmet on the homepage. It is a fitting end I thought.

> Card Stack
This stack provides an overview of everything you just saw and was an excuse to use this really cool code.

> The end
Here you can go back and revisit parts of the story if you'd like or just go back up to the homescreen. The words are also magnetic.
